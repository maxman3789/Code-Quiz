## How It Works

When the Web Page opens, the user sees the Title, instructions, and a Button. The Button starts the game.

When the Button is pressed, the first question is shown along with 4 possible answers. Of the 4 answers, 3 are incorrect. Also when the button is pressed, a Countdown Timer starts.

Each Incorrect answer takes time off the Counter, making '0' come sooner.

The Code Quiz is over when the player either answers all the questions or when the Timer reaches 0.

The Score is the remaining amount time.

After the the Questions are done, the user is asked to enter their initials.

The Initials and Score are saved on a High Score page.

One the Scores page, the user is asked to either play again (directs to index) or clear the scores (clears data).
